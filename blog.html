    <h1>1.What is the difference between var,let and const ?</h1>
    <p> Ans:The scope of a var variable is functional scope. The scope of a let variable is block scope. The scope of a const variable is block scope. It can be updated and re-declared into the scope.The differences between var, let, and const variable declaration in JavaScript include:
        Variables declared with var and const are scoped to the immediate function body.
        Variables declared with the var keyword are hoisted. Hoisting means that the variable can be accessed in their enclosing scope even before they are declared.
        Variables declared with the let keyword are block-scoped, which means the variables will have scope to the immediate enclosing block.
        
        Let us now discuss, in detail, how these keywords can make a developerâ€™s code more efficient and how to use each keyword to declare variables in JavaScript programs.</p>

    <h1>2.What is the difference between arrow function and regular function?</h1>
    <p> Ans:Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and callable. Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions.</p>

    <h1>3.Why we use template string?</h1>
    <p>Ans:Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements.</p>

    <h1>4.What is the difference between map,foreach,filter and find?</h1>
    <p>The main difference between this two methods is that forEach allows you to change elements of original array and returns undefined and map does not allow you to change original array and intended for making new array based on original one. Filter is use for geting all data from array under condition.Otherwise find use for get first element of condition. </p>
